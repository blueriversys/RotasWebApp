# RotasWebApp

An application I wrote for a friend of mine who needed a way to invoke a Google API called "direcions". 
That API returned a result set that required parsing result sets (routes), and that was complicated for him to do in Visual Basic. 

Later, I added the ability to record some statatistics on how many calls the Heroku service was being invoked on a monthly basis;
as well as the ability to return that as a result of a Web Service call (JSON).
